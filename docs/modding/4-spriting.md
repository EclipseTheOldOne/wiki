## Introducing Mindustry Spritng

First, to make Mindustry sprite, I recommend you to:

1. Get a pixel editor (Paint.NET, Aseprite, piskel, ...), i will use Aseprite in this tutorial.
2. Practice, after you've done reading how to do that in this tutorial.

After that, make your first sprite!

## Spriting Basics

### Pallete
To start making sprite, you'll need pallete for it
 - You'll need Mindustry palette. If you don't have it, get it [Here] //How do i add a link
 - If you want to make your own pallete, then you'll need to follow these rules:
    - if your sprite isn't special, use only 3 color.
    - balance colors theme, saturation and brightness between colors.
 
*There's 2 type of palette, base palette (or shading) and decal pallete,
most block have 1 base palette and 1 or more decal pallete.

### Shading

Mindustry shading are based on sprite types, here's an example
(1.Unit, 2.Block, 3.Turret)
